Example debate fixture
======================

This example debate was created to serve as an example in UI mockups, specifications, etc. It is designed to show a maximum of corner cases in a debate that is as short as possible. It was created in a role playing game caricaturing well known public figures in Québec.

Flow of messages:

* Lines are the threading of the messages, as would be seen in a mail client supporting threading
* The number at the begining of the line is the actual chronological order of the messages
* Brackets fragments of text tagged by the catcher to identify concepts. ``[FragmentId: original text fragment]``
